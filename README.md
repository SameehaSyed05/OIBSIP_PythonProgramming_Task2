# OIBSIP_PythonProgramming_Task2
📦 Packages Used

tkinter → For creating the graphical user interface (GUI)

ttk (from tkinter) → For displaying BMI history in a table format

matplotlib → For plotting BMI trend graphs

messagebox → For showing pop-up alerts and errors

🎯 Objective

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly BMI Calculator that not only calculates BMI but also:

Stores a history of calculations

Displays results in a table format

Provides a graph to track BMI progress over time

🚀 Features

Input weight (kg) and height (m) to calculate BMI

Categorizes result into:

Underweight

Normal weight

Overweight

Obese

Stores all results in a history table (weight, height, BMI, category)

Graphical visualization of BMI trends using Matplotlib

Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative values, non-numeric input)

🖥️ How It Works

Enter weight and height in the respective fields.

Click Calculate BMI → Result is displayed with BMI value and category.

Each calculation is saved in history.

Click View History → A table of past BMI calculations appears.

Click Show Graph → A trend chart of BMI values is displayed.
